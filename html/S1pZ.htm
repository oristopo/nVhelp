<h3>Smith chart for Touchstone files by gnuplot</h3>
Touchstone S1p files include columns of complex S11 values,<br>
while Smith Chart wants normalized complex impedance values.<br>
<br>
For alternating current circuits, including RF, phase and magnitude are both important.<br>
No power is consumed when potential across a load is sine and current thru it is cosine.<br>
Complex arithmatic accounts for that.<br>
<br>
To minimize getting too wrapped around an axle<br>
by complex real with square root of minus one times imaginary,<br>
let us instead focus on sin S and cos C.<br>
<br>
Normalized impedance Z<sub>in</sub> is defined for S1p value S11:<br>
<br>
Z<sub>in</sub> = (1 + S11)/(1 - S11)<br>
<br>
... where S11 is some complex value S + C:<br>
<br>
Z<sub>in</sub> = (1 + (S + C))/(1 - (S + C)) = ((1+S) + C)/((1-S) - C)<br>
<br>
For next steps, accept that:<ul>
<li> division by so-called complex <code>sin + cos</code> involves<br>
  multiplication by so-called complex conjugate <code>sin - cos</code>.
<li> so-called <i>imaginary</i> <code>cos*cos</code> become <i>real negative</i> values:<br>
<br> <code>(sin + cos)*(sin - cos) = sin*sin + cos*cos</code><br>
</ul>
This is known as <i>squared magnitude</i>.<br>
Applying complex conjugate to calculate impedance from S11<br>
and substituting <code>sin</code> = (1-S) and <code>cos</code> = C:<br>
<br>
Z<sub>in</sub> = ((1+S) + C)*((1-S) + C) / ((1-S)*(1-S) + C*C)<br>
<br>
Calculate denominator D magnitude:<br>
<br>
D = ((1-S)*(1-S) + C*C) = 1 - 2*S + S*S + C*C <br>
<br>
Collect numerator terms with single C factors separately from those without:<br>
<br>
Z<sub>in</sub> = (((1+S)*(1-S) - C*C) + C*((1-S) + (1+S)))/D<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp;= (1 - S*S - C*C)/D + 2*C/D <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> is very mature plotting software that interprets algebra</a>,<br>
for which I have nearly always used it instead of Excel.<br>
Touchstone files turn out to be compatible with gnuplot data format..<br>
In gnuplot:
<pre>set xlabel "real"
set ylabel "imaginary"
set title "file.s1p"
# denominator magnitude
D(S,C) = 1 - 2*S + S*S + C*C
# real and imaginary impedances
Zr(S,C) = (1 - S*S - C*C)/D(S,C)
Zi(S,C) = 2*C/D(S,C)
# Using second and third column values for S and C,
# plot imaginary vs real as Y vs X with lines
plot "file.s1p" u (S=$2, C=$3, Zr(S,C)):(S=$2, C=$3, Zi(S,C)) w l title "S11 Smith"

#for s2p files, plot both S11 and S21:
set title "file.s2p"
plot "file.s2p" u (S=$2, C=$3, Zr(S,C)):(S=$2, C=$3, Zi(S,C)) w l title "S11 Smith"
replot "file.s2p" u (S=$4, C=$5, Zr(S,C)):(S=$2, C=$3, Zi(S,C)) w l title "S21 Smith"
</pre>

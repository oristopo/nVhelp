<h3>nanoVNA hardware</h3>
<em>thanks to hugen, NT7S Jason, hwalker, Rune / 5Q5R</em>
<h4>the original nanoVNA by edy255 has elegant RF design</h3>

<ul compact>
<li>a single Si5351A clock
<li>three SA612AD mixers (reference, port 0 + 1)
<li>resistor bridge for port 0 "reflection"
<li>stereo TLV320AUC3204 analog-to-digital converter
  <ul compact>
  <li>left, right channels for inline, quadrature
  <li>three internally-switched single-ended input (IQ)pairs for reference, ports 0 + 1
  </ul> 
</ul>
Other hobbyist VNA, antenna analyzer, and software defined radio
designs share many of these design concepts.
This open source design was in limited distribution as a kit.
<h4>The commercialized nanoVNA-H by Hugen reduced cost and enhanced usability</h4>
<ul>
<li>working LiPo
<li>refined touch screen
<li>better PCB layout, RF shielding
<li>standalone PC software
</ul>
<h5>At least 5 nanoVNA-H implementations</h5>
<dl>
<dt>black, shields, USB-C 
<dd>Hugen gen111.taobao.com or close clone
<br><br><dt>white, micro USB "gekko"
<dd>initially most available on eBay
<br><br><dt>black, unshielded, USB-C, missing CH0 script
<dd>AKA "Worse clone"
</dl>
Variations may come
<sl compact>
<li>with or without batteries,
<li>battery leads soldered or by connector,
<li>better or worse calibration kits,
<li>SMA connectors fully soldered or not,
<li>different firmwares,
<li>calibrated (touchscreen and/or OSLT) or not.
<li>rear cover shielded or not
<li>Many vendors may ship different units over time.

<br><dt>NanoVNA-H V2
<dd>V2 will use two synthesizers that overlap and allow it to exceed a 1 GHz measurement range

<h5>nanoVNA in name only</h5>
<dl>
<dt>NanoVNA-F
<dd>Larger screen, different processor, RTOS (so obviously firmware), perhaps some similar commands.
<br>There is a good reason that this has <a href="https://groups.io/g/nanovna-f">its own group</a>
<dt>"NanoVNA 2"
<dd>completely unrelated to "NanoVNA-H V2".<br>
Just seem to have tagged onto the name
because of its popularity.
